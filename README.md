# OrbitEDU – Stay in the loop




"Being in early college classes should be exciting, but for me, it turned into a huge organizational mess. With classes at four different colleges, each with its own portal, email, and calendar, important emails got buried, and assignments were scattered across platforms. I missed deadlines and struggled with transferring credits because I couldn’t keep track of all my transcripts. I created CollegeSync to help students like me, offering a central place to track assignments, consolidate emails, and store documents like transcripts, so students can focus on learning instead of the chaos."
